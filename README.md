# Models-of-biological-systems



In this repository, you can find Matlab scripts related to the modeling of biological systems.
In particular there are seven different activities:

## 1 Compartimental model based on a linear modellization

## 2 Compartimental model based on a non-linear modellization, using ode solvers

## 3 Parametric estimation using weighted least squares on compartimental model

## 4 Parametric estimation using weighted least squares on a multi exponential model

## 5 Model based on product-substrate-enzyme concentrations

## 6 Linear regression model

## 7 Deconvolution
